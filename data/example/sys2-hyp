Today I ' m going to tell you about the unexpected discovery .
Now I ' m working on the power of the solar system .
And I ' m starting to take a little bit of my starting circle , and that ' s what we ' re going to do .
And it ' s going to look at different funds .
It ' s just a little video of what we ' re doing .
Oh . . . a minute .
We can drive a little bit of time .
( Laughter ) We ' re just — we ' re going to click on this — I ' m going to pass through the part of the video that I ' m going to use . ( Laughter )
No . ( Laughter ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) That ' s not . . . ( Laughter )
